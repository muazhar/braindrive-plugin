# OpenAIPlugin Lifecycle & Scripts

This document describes the lifecycle, install, build, and validation process for the OpenAIPlugin, following BrainDrive and NetworkEyes plugin standards.

## Lifecycle Overview
- **Initialization:** Handled by `plugin_initializer.py` for per-user setup and registration.
- **Installation:** Use `scripts/install.py` for plugin setup (expand as needed).
- **Build:** Use `scripts/build.sh` to install dependencies and build the plugin.
- **Validation:** Use `scripts/validate.py` to check build artifacts and configuration.

## Scripts

### install.py
Run installation logic for the plugin (e.g., copy files, set up config):
```
python3 scripts/install.py
```

### build.sh
Build the plugin (install dependencies and run build):
```
bash scripts/build.sh
```

### validate.py
Validate the plugin (check build, config, etc.):
```
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

## Best Practices
- Keep scripts up to date with plugin requirements.
- Use the initializer for robust setup and cleanup.
- Validate after every build or before deployment.
